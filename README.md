## [LogisticMiner](LogisticMiner)
### Logistic Storages can mine all ores/water on current planet
* Inspired by [PlanetMiner](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/blacksnipebiu/PlanetMiner)([github](https://github.com/blacksnipebiu/PlanetMiner)).
* The same speed as normal Mining Machine for normal ores and 100/s(configurable) for water.
* Can set mining scale in configuration, which makes ILS working like Advance Mining Machines: power consumption increases by the square of the scale.
* `Veins Utilization` upgrades affects mining speed and ore consumption as normal miners.
* Energy costs:  1MW/vein-group & 10MW/water-slot & 1.8MW/oil-seep(configurable), `Veins Utilization` upgrades does not increase power consumption(unlike PlanetMiner).


## [HideTips](HideTips)
### Hide/Disable various in-game tips/messages
* Tips/messages that can be hidden: random-reminder, tutorial, achievement/milestone card.
* Each type of tips/messages can be configurable individually.
* For sanity check warning messages, please check [CheatEnabler](CheatEnabler)
